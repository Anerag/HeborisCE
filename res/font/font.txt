font.txt - Unicode BDF fonts
----------------------

This directory stores the Unicode BDF fonts that are loaded. These are used for
text that should be localized. DO NOT delete these files, as they are required
when loading Heboris.

The game only supports Unicode BDF fonts, with the text functions using UTF-8
encoded text.
